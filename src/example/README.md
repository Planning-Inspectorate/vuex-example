These two files are to show the comparison between a Vue component and store module. There are largely equivalent concepts:

| Component | Store | Description |
|----|----|----|
|data|state|State/data to store|
|n/a|mutations|Edit store state|
|computed|getter|Computed properties, reactive based on state|
|methods|actions|Functions to call APIs or similar|
